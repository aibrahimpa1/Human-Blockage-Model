# Human-Blockage-Model
The use of extremely high frequency (EHF) or millimeter-wave (mmWave) band has attracted significant at-
tention for the next generation wireless access networks.  mmWave frequencies render themselves quite sensitive to “blocking” caused by obstacles like foliage, humans, vehicles, etc. However, there is a dearth of analytical models for characterizing such blocking and
the consequent effect on the signal reliability. I
proposed a general model for characterizing
the blocking caused by humans (assuming them to be randomly located in the environment) to mmWave propagation as a function of system parameters like transmitter-receiver locations and dimensions, as well as density and dimensions of humans.
